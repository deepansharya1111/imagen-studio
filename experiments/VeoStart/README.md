VeoStart: Your Veo Prompting Assistant
VeoStart is a web-based tool designed to help users craft high-quality, effective prompts for Google's Veo video generation model. It provides a structured interface for building prompts from scratch and a gallery of examples to inspire creativity.

This entire application is self-contained in a single index.html file, making it extremely portable and easy to deploy.

Text-to-Video Prompt Generator: Build detailed video prompts by specifying a subject, action, and scene, and then refine them with specific camera angles, movements, lens effects, and visual styles.

Image-to-Video Prompt Generator: Upload an image and add dynamic motion by selecting from a comprehensive list of camera, subject, and environmental animation options.

Gemini-Powered Prompt Enhancement: Both generators use Gemini to intelligently synthesize your selected keywords into an optimal, cinematic prompt ready for Veo.
