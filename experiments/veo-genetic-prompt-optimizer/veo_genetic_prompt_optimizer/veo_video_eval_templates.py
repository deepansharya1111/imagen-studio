VEO_VIDEO_REALIZATION_QUALITY_TEMPLATE = """
# Instruction
You are an expert evaluator of generative video quality. Your task is to evaluate a video generated by an AI model based on a text prompt.
Your goal is to assess how well the video realizes the prompt's vision, its technical quality, and its overall aesthetic appeal.

You must carefully analyze the video based on the provided prompt and the evaluation criteria, then provide a score from 1 to 5 and a detailed rationale.

**Prompt:**
{prompt}

# Evaluation Criteria
1.  **Prompt Adherence (Weight: 50%)**: How accurately does the video reflect ALL aspects of the prompt, including the subject, action, scene, style, and any specified cinematography? This is the most critical factor.
2.  **Visual Quality & Artifacts (Weight: 25%)**: How clear, sharp, and aesthetically pleasing is the video? Assess for distracting visual glitches, distortion, flickering, unnatural textures, or object morphing.
3.  **Motion Coherence (Weight: 25%)**: Is the movement in the video smooth, natural, and physically plausible? Does the motion of subjects and the camera (if specified) feel coherent and consistent?

# Rating Rubric
5 (Excellent): The video is a near-perfect, high-fidelity realization of the prompt with coherent motion and strong aesthetic appeal.
4 (Good): The video successfully captures the prompt's intent with good visual quality, though it may have minor inaccuracies or motion flaws.
3 (Adequate): The video represents the main idea of the prompt but misses important details or has noticeable visual/motion flaws.
2 (Poor): The video struggles to represent the prompt, containing significant inaccuracies and technical issues.
1 (Very Poor): The video completely fails to represent the prompt and has severe technical or coherence issues.

# Task
Based on your analysis of the criteria above, provide a score and a detailed step-by-step reasoning for your choice, referencing specific examples from the video and the prompt.

PAIRWISE_VEO_VIDEO_REALIZATION_QUALITY_TEMPLATE = """
# Instruction
You are an expert evaluator of generative video quality. Your task is to compare two videos (Video A and Video B), both generated from the same text prompt. Your goal is to determine which video is a more successful and higher-quality realization of the prompt.

You must carefully analyze both videos based on the provided prompt and the evaluation criteria.

**Prompt:**
{prompt}

# Evaluation Criteria
1.  **Prompt Adherence**: Which video more accurately reflects ALL aspects of the prompt, including the subject, action, scene, style, and any specified cinematography?
2.  **Visual Quality & Artifacts**: Which video has higher visual fidelity and fewer distracting glitches (flickering, morphing, distortion)?
3.  **Motion Coherence**: Which video has smoother, more natural, and more physically plausible motion?

# Task
Based on your analysis of the criteria above, which video is better?

- If Video A is significantly better, choose "A".
- If Video B is significantly better, choose "B".
- If they are of comparable quality or have different but equally weighted strengths and weaknesses, choose "SAME".

Provide a detailed step-by-step reasoning for your choice, referencing specific examples from the videos and the prompt to justify your decision.

VEO_VIDEO_REALIZATION_QUALITY_TEMPLATE_W_IMAGE = """
# Instruction
You are an expert evaluator of generative video quality. Your task is to evaluate a video generated by an AI model based on a text prompt and a **reference image**.
Your goal is to assess how well the video animates the reference image according to the prompt's vision, its technical quality, and its overall aesthetic appeal.

You must carefully analyze the video based on the provided prompt, reference image, and the evaluation criteria, then provide a score from 1 to 5 and a detailed rationale.

**Prompt:**
{prompt}

(A reference image is also provided for your evaluation)

# Evaluation Criteria
1.  **Image and Prompt Adherence (Weight: 50%)**: How accurately does the video animate the subject/scene from the reference image while adhering to the text prompt? This is the most critical factor.
2.  **Visual Quality & Artifacts (Weight: 25%)**: How clear, sharp, and aesthetically pleasing is the video? Assess for distracting visual glitches, distortion, flickering, unnatural textures, or object morphing.
3.  **Motion Coherence (Weight: 25%)**: Is the movement in the video smooth, natural, and physically plausible for the subject in the image?

# Rating Rubric
5 (Excellent): The video is a near-perfect, high-fidelity animation of the reference image, perfectly guided by the prompt. It has coherent motion and strong aesthetic appeal.
4 (Good): The video successfully animates the reference image according to the prompt's intent, with good visual quality, though it may have minor inaccuracies or motion flaws.
3 (Adequate): The video represents the main idea of animating the image but misses important details from the prompt or has noticeable visual/motion flaws.
2 (Poor): The video struggles to represent an animation of the image as guided by the prompt, containing significant inaccuracies and technical issues.
1 (Very Poor): The video completely fails to represent the prompt or the image and has severe technical or coherence issues.
