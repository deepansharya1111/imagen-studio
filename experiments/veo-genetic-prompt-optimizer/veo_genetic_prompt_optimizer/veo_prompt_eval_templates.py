# Instruction
You are an expert in prompt engineering and AI instruction design. Your task is to evaluate the quality of a **metaprompt**. A metaprompt is a set of instructions given to a powerful AI to rewrite a simple user query into a detailed, effective prompt for a text-to-video model. A high-quality metaprompt is clear, comprehensive, and effectively guides the AI to produce creative and technically sound video prompts.

# Evaluation
## Metric Definition
You will be assessing **Metaprompt Effectiveness**. This measures how well the metaprompt instructs a language model to generate high-quality, creative, and effective video prompts that adhere to best practices.

## Criteria
1.  **Guidance on Core Goal**: Does the metaprompt clearly define the primary objective: to enhance visual quality and motion while strictly preserving the user's original intent?
2.  **Guidance on Subject Detailing**:
    *   Does it instruct the AI to add specific, believable characteristics to people (hairstyle, expression, clothing, etc.)?
    *   Does it provide nuanced rules for adding diversity (ethnicity, gender) in a believable and historically appropriate manner?
3.  **Guidance on Cinematic & Visual Enhancement**:
    *   Does it explicitly list and encourage the use of a wide range of visual details (camera angles, lighting, camera motion, styles, color schemes, backgrounds)?
    *   Does it promote the use of "quality identifiers" like 'cinematic shot' or 'award winning'?
4.  **Guidance on Constraint Handling & Intent Preservation**:
    *   Does it strongly emphasize that every detail from the original query must be kept?
    *   Does it provide clear rules for handling long/detailed queries, or queries that are not visual in nature?
    *   Does it include important constraints, such as refraining from adding minors unnecessarily?
    *   Does it guide the AI on how to emphasize or repeat key features for faithful rendering?
5.  **Overall Clarity and Structure**: Is the metaprompt well-organized, clear, and unambiguous for an AI to follow? Does it provide concrete examples to guide the AI?

## Rating Rubric
**5 (Excellent)**: Exceptionally clear and comprehensive. Provides strong, explicit guidance on all key components: core goal, subject detailing, cinematic enhancement, and constraint handling (including emphasis and repetition). Its instructions are robust and likely to produce consistently superior rewrites.
**4 (Good)**: Clear and effective. Provides good guidance across most components but might be slightly less specific in one area (e.g., its list of cinematic terms could be more extensive, or its rules on constraints could be clearer).
**3 (Adequate)**: Understandable but lacks depth. Gives general instructions (e.g., "add details and cinematic terms") without the necessary specificity, examples, or nuanced rules for handling different types of queries.
**2 (Poor)**: Vague or overly simplistic. Lacks clear, actionable instructions on most of the key components required for a high-quality rewrite.
**1 (Very Poor)**: Highly ambiguous, contradictory, or incomplete. Fails to provide the fundamental guidance needed to transform a simple query into a high-quality video prompt.

## Evaluation Steps
STEP 1: Assess how clearly the metaprompt defines the **Core Goal**.
STEP 2: Evaluate the depth and nuance of its guidance on **Subject Detailing**, including the rules for diversity.
STEP 3: Analyze the comprehensiveness of its guidance on **Cinematic & Visual Enhancement**. Does it provide a rich toolkit for the AI?
STEP 4: Scrutinize the rules for **Constraint Handling & Intent Preservation**, including guidance on emphasizing key features. Are they robust and clear?
STEP 5: Judge the **Overall Clarity and Structure** of the metaprompt as a set of instructions.
STEP 6: Assign a rating from the rubric based on your analysis and provide a detailed rationale.

VEO_PROMPT_INTENT_PRESERVATION_TEMPLATE = """
# Instruction
You are an expert evaluator of creative text-to-video prompts. Your task is to compare an 'Augmented Prompt' against the 'Original Prompt' to determine how well the original intent has been preserved. The goal of an augmentation is to enhance a prompt with detail, not to change its core meaning.

# Evaluation
## Metric Definition
You will be assessing **Intent Preservation**. This measures how faithfully the 'Augmented Prompt' retains the core subjects, actions, relationships, and explicit details of the 'Original Prompt'.

## Criteria
1.  **Core Concept Retention**: Does the augmented prompt retain all key subjects, their primary actions, and the fundamental setting described in the original? (e.g., if the original is "a cat in a garden," the augmented prompt must still be about a cat in a garden).
2.  **Detail and Constraint Preservation**: Are all specific details, modifiers, and constraints from the original prompt (e.g., "a *fluffy ginger* cat," "wearing a *blue* collar," "*cinematic shot*") present in the augmented prompt?
3.  **Avoidance of Contradiction**: Does the augmented prompt add details that contradict or negate the original intent? (e.g., changing "a happy dog" to "a sad dog," or "a cat *in* a garden" to "a cat *next to* a garden").
4.  **Spirit and Mood Preservation**: Does the augmented prompt maintain the overall mood or spirit implied by the original? (e.g., a prompt for a "peaceful beach" should not be augmented into a "stormy, chaotic beach").

## Rating Rubric
**5 (Excellent)**: Perfect preservation. All concepts, details, and the overall spirit of the original prompt are perfectly retained in the augmented prompt.
**4 (Good)**: Minor deviation. All core concepts are preserved, but a minor, non-essential detail from the original might be slightly altered or omitted. The core intent is clearly intact.
**3 (Adequate)**: Partial preservation. The main idea is preserved, but some secondary concepts or important details have been changed or omitted, leading to a noticeable shift from the original intent.
**2 (Poor)**: Significant deviation. A core concept, subject, or action has been significantly altered or removed, leading to a prompt that only loosely resembles the original.
**1 (Very Poor)**: Complete deviation. The augmented prompt fundamentally misunderstands, contradicts, or ignores the original intent.

## Evaluation Steps
STEP 1: Identify the core subjects, actions, and setting in the **Original Prompt**.
STEP 2: Verify that all these core concepts are present and correctly represented in the **Augmented Prompt**.
STEP 3: Identify all specific details, modifiers, and constraints in the **Original Prompt** and check if they are preserved in the **Augmented Prompt**.
STEP 4: Check for any new information in the **Augmented Prompt** that contradicts the original concepts or details.
STEP 5: Assign a rating from the rubric based on your analysis and provide a detailed rationale.

STEP 1: **Analyze Image Fidelity**: Compare the prompt's description to the reference image. Does it accurately describe the subject and style? Does it propose a plausible animation?
STEP 2: **Analyze Intent Preservation**: Carefully compare the rewritten prompt against the original user query.
STEP 3: **Evaluate Detail Enrichment**: Assess the quality and specificity of the added details.
STEP 4: **Scrutinize Cinematic Language**: Evaluate the use of technical terms.
STEP 5: **Assess Overall Vision**: Judge the final prompt as a whole. Is it cohesive and compelling?
STEP 6: Assign a rating from 1-5 and provide a detailed rationale.

# Instruction
You are an expert evaluator of creative text-to-video prompts. Your task is to compare an 'Augmented Prompt' against the 'Original Prompt' and a **reference image** to determine how well the original intent has been preserved.

# Evaluation
## Metric Definition
You will be assessing **Intent Preservation**. This measures how faithfully the 'Augmented Prompt' retains the core subjects, actions, and details of the 'Original Prompt', AND the visual characteristics of the reference image.

## Criteria
1.  **Image Content Preservation (Crucial)**: Does the augmented prompt accurately reflect the main subject, objects, and environment shown in the reference image?
2.  **Core Concept Retention**: Does the augmented prompt retain all key subjects, actions, and the fundamental setting from the original text prompt?
3.  **Detail and Constraint Preservation**: Are all specific details and constraints from the original text prompt present in the augmented prompt?
4.  **Avoidance of Contradiction**: Does the augmented prompt add details that contradict either the original text prompt or the reference image?

## Rating Rubric
**5 (Excellent)**: Perfect preservation. All concepts and details from the original prompt AND the reference image are perfectly retained.
**4 (Good)**: Minor deviation. All core concepts are preserved, but a minor detail from the original prompt or image might be slightly altered. The core intent is clearly intact.
**3 (Adequate)**: Partial preservation. The main idea is preserved, but some important details from the prompt or image have been changed or omitted.
**2 (Poor)**: Significant deviation. A core concept from the prompt or a key visual element from the image has been significantly altered or removed.
**1 (Very Poor)**: Complete deviation. The augmented prompt fundamentally misunderstands or contradicts the original prompt or the reference image.

## Evaluation Steps
STEP 1: **Identify Key Visuals**: Identify the key visual elements (subject, style, environment) in the **Reference Image**.
STEP 2: **Identify Core Text Concepts**: Identify the core subjects, actions, and setting in the **Original Prompt**.
STEP 3: **Verify Preservation**: Verify that all these core concepts (from both image and text) are present and correctly represented in the **Augmented Prompt**.
STEP 4: **Check for Contradictions**: Check for any new information in the **Augmented Prompt** that contradicts the original sources.
STEP 5: Assign a rating from the rubric based on your analysis and provide a detailed rationale.
